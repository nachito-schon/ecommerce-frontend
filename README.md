# Ecommerce Frontend

This is a **Single-Page** that shows products provided by [ecommerce-backend API](https://github.com/nachito-schon/ecommerce-backend).

You can swipe through all items clicking on the arrows on both sides of the page, and click on the item to see a detailed view with the product's description and brand.

It's a **fully responsive** website, so it's designed for both mobile and desktop.

## Tech-stack

This application was mainly built with **React**, **TypeScript** and **Tailwind**, using **[Headless UI](https://headlessui.com/)** for the product-view modal.
